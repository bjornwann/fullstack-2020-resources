  // Here's an array which the next few tasks will build upon. Don't change it here!
  const months = ["Jon", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "Jun", "May", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov"]

  // You can modify arrays in a similar way to how you fetched a single value, and then using
  // assignment to give it a new value. For example, there's a typo in the first month of the
  // months array. It says "Jon" but it should say "Jan". To fix this, we can find the 1st
  // item (counting from 0) and assign it a new value:
  months[0] = "Jan"

  // Task 1: Use console.log() to print the months array. Notice how the first month is fixed!


  // Task 2: The array of months above has another mistake; "Jun" comes before "May". Without
  // modifying the line above, use assignment to fix the mistake by re-assigning the 5th
  // and 6th items in the array. After you've done that, use console.log() to log the
  // months array.


  // Task 3: Arrays have a property which you can use to find the number of items it contains.
  // Try to find it in the docs and then use it in a console.log() below to print the number
  // of items in the months array. (Docs: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp)


  // Task 4: There's another problem with the array! It's missing December.. No christmas!!! Fix it
  // by using months.push() to add a new item to the end of the array and then use console.log()
  // to print the array to the console. Check the docs for more information on .push().


  // Task 5: There's another function which can be called to remove an item from the array
  // (it was in the lecture on JavaScript, or try to find it in the docs). Use it to remove
  // the last item from the array and then print the months array using console.log()


  // Task 6: Using splice(), you can remove items from the middle of arrays. It requires two
  // arguments; first, the index from where you'd like to start deleting, and second, the
  // number of items you'd like to delete. Use .splice() to remove "Jul" from the months array.
