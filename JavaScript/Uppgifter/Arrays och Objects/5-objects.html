  // Objects allow you to store data and functions. Unlike arrays,
  // they are not ordered, and so do not use indexes at all for
  // retrieving or modifying their values. Instead they use keys and values
  // to store pointers to data.
  //
  // Have a read through the documentation here before you begin: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp
  // The documentation mentions methods, which is where you assign a
  // function to a key in the object. We'll be focusing entirely on the more simple
  // version it mentioned; properties.

  // Task 1: Below is a variable called person which has an object assigned to it.
  // The object has one property with the key (studentAt) which has a string "Chas Academy" as its
  // value. Add two more properties (keys and values) to the object; one called name which
  // should store your name as a string, and one called age which should store
  // your age as a number.
  const person = {
    studentAt: "Chas Academy"
  }

  console.log(person)

  // Task 2: Add a fourth property to the object using the key `favoriteFoods`. Its value
  // should be an array of strings with some foods you like.


  // Task 3: Use the dot notation to print the name and age properties from the person
  // object using console.log.


  // Task 4: You can add a property to an object using the dot notation and using assignment to
  // set a its value. Do this to add a new property to the person object with the key `eyeColor`
  // and value being a string with the color of your eyes.


  // Task 5: Objects can be nested within other objects. To fetch a value, you must chain
  // the dot notation. For example, you could select the entire `adult` object from the
  // `dog` object below using the notation `dog.labrador.adult`. Using the dog object below,
  // use console.log() to print the name of the puppy (so it should print "Buster").
  const dogs = {
    labrador: {
      adult: {
        name: "Marley"
      },
      puppy: {
        name: "Buster"
      }
    }
  }
