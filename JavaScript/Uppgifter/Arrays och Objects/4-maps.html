  // The last examples used forEach to iterate over an array. .forEach() invoked
  // a function for each item in an array, but doesn't actually return anything.

  const dogs = ["Labrador", "Beagle", "Poodle", "Pug", "Chihuahua"]

  // This function is similar to the last task of the iteration challenges, except
  // it returns a string from the function instead of using console.log().
  const doggieWalks = dogs.forEach((dogName) => {
    return "The " + dogName + " needs to go for a walk!"
  })

  // Task 1: Use console.log to log the `doggieWalks` variable below to see what was
  // actually returned from .forEach()


  // Task 2: Now change .forEach to .map on line 9 and run the code again.
  // See the difference? .map() returns the values from the function. The `return`
  // in the mapping function is very important. Try removing it to see what happens.


  // Task 3: Create a new variable called `shoutyDogNames` and assign it to a new
  // dogs.map() call. Inside the dogs.map() call, write a function which returns a
  // dog's name in uppercase. Finally, log the `shoutyDogNames` variable.
