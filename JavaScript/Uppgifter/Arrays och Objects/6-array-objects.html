  // This task pulls together the previous two tasks to practice a more "real" data
  // structure you'd see regularly as a web developer.
  //
  // Consider the following array of product objects:
  const products = [
    { name: "Camera", brand: "Canon", model: "EOS 70D" },
    { name: "Camera", brand: "Nikon", model: "D3400" },
    { name: "Camera", brand: "GoPro", model: "Hero 4" },
    { name: "Drone", brand: "DJI", model: "Phantom" },
    { name: "Drone", brand: "GoPro", model: "Karma" }
  ]

  // Task 1: Write a .forEach function which iterates through the products
  // and uses console.log() to print the name and brand of each item.


  // Task 2: Use .map() to iterate over the products and return the model from
  // each product. Assign the result to a variable called `models` and use console.log()
  // to print it.
